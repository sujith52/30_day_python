#### ✅ Q1: What will this output?

```python
def mystery(x):
    return x[::-1]

print(mystery("hello"))
```

#### ✅ Q2: What’s the difference between a list and a tuple?

#### ✅ Q3: Write a function that checks if a number is **prime**.

#### ✅ Q4: What's the purpose of `__init__` in a class?

#### ✅ Q5: Convert this list to a set and remove duplicates:

```python
nums = [2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 3, 4]
```

        answers now 

q1) olleh -- this will make the loop to get run in a reverse loop mode

Q2) list is an collection of items or values which is mutable
    while the tuple is inmutable it coundt not modifided like list

Q3)num = int(input("Enter the num :))
    def prime(num):
        if num %= 0:
            print("It is prime")
        else:
            print("NOT prime)

Q4) __init__ class is used to pass the string values like __init__(self,name,num)
    it is used to define functions in a simple order

Q5)
import pandas as pd
nums = [2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 3, 4]

df = df.DataFrame(nums)
prime(df.drop_duplicates())


finally on 23-05-2025 at 4:57 pm i have completed my python journey
i believe that it has more
i need to to leaen more indepth
i think there will be always mistakes so i willleaarn 
at last 

"UNTIL DEATH DEFEAT IS PYSOCOLOGICAL"
